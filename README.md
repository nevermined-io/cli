## Installation

```
npm install -g @nevermined-io/cli

or

yarn global add @nevermined-io/cli
```

After doing that you should have available in your system the `ncli` tool.

```
$ ncli --help
```

## Usage

**Setup Accounts**:

- Option 1: Use a mnemonic

```
export MNEMONIC="<your 12 words seed phrase>"
```

- Option 2: Use keyfiles

```
export KEYFILE_PATH="<path to keyfile>"
export KEYFILE_PASSWORD="<keyfile password>"
```

---

```
export NODE_URL="https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/INFURA_TOKEN"
or
export NODE_URL="https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/-ALCHEMY_TOKEN"

to switch the token address (optional):
export TOKEN_ADDRESS="<your erc20 compatible token address>"
if you want to use the native token of the network where you are operating you can specify the 0x0 address
export TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x0
```


## Environment variables

* `NETWORK` - Allows to uses one of the existing pre-configured Nevermined networks. Example: `geth-localnet`, `mumbai`, `matic`, `goerli`. You can see the full list of networks supported running `ncli network list`
* `NODE_URL` - JSON-RPC server. It could be an Infura or Alchemy url too. Example: `http://localhost:8545`
* `TOKEN_ADDRESS` - The ERC20 token address to use for the transactions. If not given or if is `0x0` the payments will be made in the network native token (ETH, Matic, ..)
* `GATEWAY_URL` - The url of the gateway to use. If not given the default url is: `http://localhost:8030`
* `MARKETPLACE_API_URL` - The url of the marketplace api to use. If not given the default url is: `http://localhost:3100`
* `FAUCET_URL` - The url of the faucet to use. If not given the default url is: `http://localhost:3001`
* `IPFS_GATEWAY` - The url of the IPFS gateway used to upload/download contents. By default is `https://ipfs.infura.io:5001`
* `GATEWAY_ADDRESS` - The public address of the gateway. If not given the default address is: `0x068ed00cf0441e4829d9784fcbe7b9e26d4bd8d0`
* `GAS_MULTIPLIER` - For networks with some congestion, this parameter can help to increase the gas spent and speed up the transactions. If not given the default is `0`.

## Networks

The CLI has pre-configured some Nevermined environments. You can check what is pre-configured using the `network list` command:

```
$ ncli network list
Nevermined pre-configured networks:

 mumbai:
        Public testnet environment where users can interact with Nevermined protocol.
        Is a Production environment? false

        Node Uri: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
        Gateway: https://gateway.mumbai.public.nevermined.rocks
        Marketplace API: https://marketplace-api.mumbai.public.nevermined.rocks
        Faucet: https://faucet.mumbai.public.nevermined.rocks


 defiMumbai:
        Testnet environment for the DeFi Marketplace.
        Is a Production environment? false

        Node Uri: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
        Gateway: https://defi.v2.gateway.mumbai.nevermined.rocks
        Marketplace API: https://defi.v2.marketplace-api.mumbai.nevermined.rocks
        Faucet: https://faucet.mumbai.public.nevermined.rocks


 autonomiesMumbai:
        Testnet environment for the Autonomies Marketplace.
        Is a Production environment? false

        Node Uri: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
        Gateway: https://gateway.autonomies.test.nevermined.rocks
        Marketplace API: https://marketplace-api.autonomies.test.nevermined.rocks
        Faucet: https://faucet.mumbai.public.nevermined.rocks


```

A part of these networks you can connect to any other network using the environment variables described above.

When you want to connect and interact with a different network of the default (`mumbai`), make sure you have exported the `NODE_URL` environment variable connected to the right environment, and pass the `-n NETWORK_NAME` parameter to your commands.
