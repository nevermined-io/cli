# Using the CLI

Once you have created your account and have some funds, you are ready to start using the `ncli` to interact with different Nevermined networks.

Let's first setup the main config we need:

```bash
export MNEMONIC="YOUR 12 WORDS SEED PHRASE"
export NETWORK=mumbai
export NODE_URL="the node url valid for the network you are connecting"
```

:::tip

If you don't know what **NODE_URL** use, we recommend get a free account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://alchemyapi.io/).

:::

## What environments can I use?

You can get the list of all the pre-configured environmnets running:

```bash
ncli network list
```

And later see the status of any of them:

```bash
ncli network status
```

## Let's create a new account and check the balance

Create a new account using the `ncli` by running:

```bash
ncli accounts new
```

This command will print all the relevant information like mnemonic, private key, public address of a derived account, etc. Make sure to save all this information if you want to use this account later.

To use the recently created account you just need to export the mnemonic in an environment variable:

```bash
export MNEMONIC="curious harsh offer relax choose reveal series actress message suspect today vocal"
```

In the testnets with a faucet available, you can get some funds running:

```bash
ncli accounts fund 0xe2DD09d719Da89e5a3D0F2549c7E24566e947260
```

:::caution

This command can fail if there is no a faucet available in the network you are using or the faucet is running out of funds/

:::

Getting the balance of an account is possible running:

```bash
ncli accounts balance 0xe2DD09d719Da89e5a3D0F2549c7E24566e947260
```

## Assets

### Registering new assets

Nevermined is all about registering digital assets and providing services on top of them. The most basic one is about **data sharing**. We are going to register a new asset and set a price of 1 ETH for accessing to the file attached to that asset:

```bash
ncli assets register-asset --name 'A picture about myself' --author 'John Doe' --price 1 --urls https://www.kazoart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23-magritte-uomo-con-mela-100x70-70x50_jpg.jpg --contentType image/jpeg
```

:::info

As a result of running this command, you will get a Decentralized Identifier (aka **DID**). This refers to a unique asset registered in the Nevermined network.

:::

In this example we are using a public url, but with Nevermined you also could do:

* Add multiple urls referring to multiple files
* Use a cid for referring a content is in IPFS or Filecoin
* Publish the url of content that is not publicly available (for example on premise in your own server or in the cloud). You could protect that content running your own [Nevermined Gateway](/docs/architecture/gateway/).

:::info

In Nevermined when you register an asset, the URL referring to the asset is **encrypted**.

:::

The price you assign is related to the default token price of the network you are connected to. This can be a Native token (ETH, MATIC, etc) or an ERC20.
You can control this exporting the **TOKEN_ADDRESS** environment variable.

:::info

You can find more information about the `TOKEN_ADDRESS` variable in the [advanced configuration section](advanced_configuration.md).

:::

You can register a new asset using the metadata from a JSON file (example of [metadata here](https://github.com/nevermined-io/cli/blob/main/test/resources/example-1.json)):

```
ncli assets import  --metadata /tmp/my_asset_metadata.json
```

### Resolving an Asset

One registered asset in Nevermined is composed by 2 parts:

* The **metadata** describing the file (tile, author, description, etc)
* Some ids stored in the Smart contracts. This includes the **DID** and the reference to the metadata

Once an asset is registered and we have the reference to it via the **DID**, you can resolve the metadata using that DID. 

```bash
 ncli assets resolve did:nv:e23aeb13dc398be20b6718237a60793d4491d7da8aef53182ad2f05d8666c8d8
```

### Searching for stuff

With the CLI you can search across all the metadata of all the assets published in the Nevermined environment. You can do that running:

```bash
ncli assets search  "John Doe"
```

### Purchasing and downloading assets

Now we know how to publish assets, we can examine how to interact with them. For example running the `assets download` option the publisher of the assets can download the files:

```bash
ncli assets download  did:nv:e23aeb13dc398be20b6718237a60793d4491d7da8aef53182ad2f05d8666c8d8  --path /tmp 
```

:::caution

Only the owner of the DID can use this command to download the assets. Other users have to purchase them.

:::

So if you are not the owner, you can purchase access to the asset running the order command. But first you need to make sure you are using a different account to the owner one:

```bash
export MNEMONIC="your awesome seed phrase that holds tokens on the network of choice"
ncli assets order did:nv:e23aeb13dc398be20b6718237a60793d4491d7da8aef53182ad2f05d8666c8d8
```

This command will return a unique service agreement id (or agreement id). This works as a receipt of your recent purchase. It gives you access to the files attached to the asset:

```bash
ncli assets get did:nv:e23aeb13dc398be20b6718237a60793d4491d7da8aef53182ad2f05d8666c8d8 --agreementId 0x13d435886660cd2c411fd758db09db04b48ca1f1901b0bb449812e6e2eb603f3 --path /tmp
```

## NFTs

In Nevermined you can use NFTs (ERC-721 or ERC-1155) as a mechanism to tokenize digital assets and control the access to their digital files. Here we show how to use them with the CLI.

:::info

On this page we are going to use NFTs based in ERC-721, but most of this commands work similarly for ERC-1155 NFTs.

:::

### Deploying a new NFT contract

When you compile a Smart Contract you generate an ABI that includes the definiton of the public interface of the contract and the bytecode. Having an ABI you can deploy it on a network running the following command:

```bash
ncli nfts721 deploy MyERC721.json
```

If everything is okay, you need to have sufficient funds to pay the balance on the network you are deploying your asset(s). This command will pull the address where this contract has been deployed. Copy that address for the next commands.

### Registering an asset with a NFT attached

We previously registered an asset that allowed limited downloads for people purchasing it. Now we will register a similar asset but with a ERC-721 NFT attached to it. The first parameter is the contract address of the NFT:

```bash
ncli nfts721 create 0x726baA2f854A3BEC2378a707AeB38c9d933Ebad6 --name 'A picture about myself' --author 'John Doe' --price 1 --urls https://www.kazoart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23-magritte-uomo-con-mela-100x70-70x50_jpg.jpg --contentType image/jpeg
```

As you can see, this command is very similar to the previous one. The main difference is here we have defined that payment of 1 token will result in receiving an ERC-721 NFT. Whoever holds that NFT will be able to get access to the urls passed as parameter.

If the asset was registered properly, you got a DID with more information about the asset running:

```bash
ncli nfts721 show  "did:nv:b7b7a12fa80477d2c75fb730ec4c378445519bba7c816f10740ca564acbea06c" --nftAddress 0x726baA2f854A3BEC2378a707AeB38c9d933Ebad6
```

### Minting

With this command the asset owner can mint a NFT associated to the asset:

```bash
ncli nfts721 mint "did:nv:b7b7a12fa80477d2c75fb730ec4c378445519bba7c816f10740ca564acbea06c" 0x726baA2f854A3BEC2378a707AeB38c9d933Ebad6 --uri http://nevermined.io/metadata.json
```

### Purchase and download

So now using a different account you can purchase that asset:

```
export MNEMONIC="your awesome seed phrase that holds tokens on the network of choice"

ncli nfts721 order did:nv:b7b7a12fa80477d2c75fb730ec4c378445519bba7c816f10740ca564acbea06c
```

If everything was executed properly, now you should be able to download the files attached to the asset and protected by the NFT as access control:

```bash
ncli nfts721 download did:nv:b7b7a12fa80477d2c75fb730ec4c378445519bba7c816f10740ca564acbea06c --destination /tmp
```

You can check if the account you used to purchase the asset now has the NFT:

```bash
ncli accounts balance 0xBE5449a6A97aD46c8558A3356267Ee5D2731ab5e --nftTokenAddress 0x726baA2f854A3BEC2378a707AeB38c9d933Ebad6
```
